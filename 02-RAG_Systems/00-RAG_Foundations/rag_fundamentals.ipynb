    "Imagine an employee named **Alex**. Alex works for a major technology company that has thousands of internal documents—manuals, policies, and quarterly reports—spread across ancient shared drives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alex is building a critical report for a client and needs to know the warranty period for a specific product line, the **Alpha 7** model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Alex turns to the company's AI Chatbot.** This chatbot was trained years ago on a massive, general dataset.\n",
    "* **Query:** \"What is the warranty period for the Alpha 7?\"\n",
    "* **The AI's Reply (without RAG):** \"The standard warranty is 18 months, according to the general hardware terms I was trained on.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Alex feels confident... until the real world hits. The Alpha 7 was part of a special program launched *last month* where the warranty was **extended to 36 months**. The AI was confident, but it was confidentially **wrong**. It was stuck in the past.\n",
