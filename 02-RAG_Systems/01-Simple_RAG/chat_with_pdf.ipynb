       "| **🌐 Common LLM (No Context)** | Below-ground it is normally specified as an “air-entraining admixture for concrete and mortar”.  <br>Although every producer will issue its own technical data sheet, the way you use any of the “Classic Airent / Classic-AirEntrainer” type products is practically the same.<br><br>1. Identify why you need it  <br>   • Improve workability without adding extra water.  <br>   • Produce a stable system of microscopic air bubbles (3-7 % total air) so concrete or mortar can resist freeze–thaw and de-icing salts.  <br><br>2. Determine the target air content  <br>   • Plain concrete 4 % ±1 % (medium workability, 20-25 mm agg.)  <br>   • Severe exposure / paving 6 % ±1 % (≤19 mm agg.)  <br>   • Mortar/plaster normally 10-18 % depending on project specification.  <br><br>3. Decide the trial-mix dosage  <br>Typical guide values:  <br>   • 0.05–0.15 % by mass of cement (50–150 mℓ/100 kg cement)  <br>   • Start at mid-range (0.08 %) and adjust after you have measured the actual air content in a pressure-meter.  <br>Never exceed the maximum value given on the manufacturer’s sheet.<br><br>4. Mixing sequence  <br>   a. Charge 70 % of the total water in the mixer.  <br>   b. Add all the “Classic Airent” with that water.  <br>   c. Add cement, sand, coarse aggregate.  <br>   d. Add remaining water in stages until the specified slump/flow is reached.  <br>   e. Mix for a further 60–90 s to make sure the air bubbles are uniformly dispersed.  <br>If batching plant is used, meter the admixture through a calibrated dispenser; do not just “hand dose”.<br><br>5. Combine with other admixtures carefully  <br>   • Water-reducers/plasticisers: usually compatible, but they often lower air content, so you may have to increase Classic Airent slightly.  <br>   • Accelerators or retarders: do trial mixes.  <br>   • Never premix different liquid admixtures in the same container.<br><br>6. Quality control on site  <br>   • Check air content every 50 m³ (or at least once per shift).  <br>   • Check slump. Do not add extra water after discharge; that destroys the bubble system.  <br>   • If pumping, keep pressure <8 MPa and use smooth elbows to minimise air loss.  <br>   • Finish and cure in the normal manner; the entrained air does not remove the need for curing.<br><br>7. Storage and shelf life  <br>   • Keep containers tightly closed, out of direct sunlight, 5–35 °C.  <br>   • Protect from frost—if frozen, most air-entrainers are ruined.  <br>   • Shelf life is usually 12 months.<br><br>8. Safety  <br>   • Mildly alkaline; wear gloves and goggles.  <br>   • Wash off splashes with plenty of water.<br><br>Quick reference example (for 25 MPa paving mix):  <br>Cement 330 kg, water 170 ℓ, w/c 0.52, sand 700 kg, 19 mm agg. 1 050 kg.  <br>Target air 6 %.  <br>Start with Classic Airent 300 mℓ (≈0.09 % of cement).  <br>Measure air—if you get only 4.5 %, raise dose to 380 mℓ on the next truck.<br><br>In short: measure, adjust, don’t overdose, and always verify the air content with a pressure meter before the concrete is poured. |\n"
