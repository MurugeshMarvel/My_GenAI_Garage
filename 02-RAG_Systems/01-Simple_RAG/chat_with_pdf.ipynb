The long-term survivability of FOSS projects is <br>contingent upon them being associated with a <br>foundation that provides support and oversees <br>its governance. Otherwise, they risk becoming <br>EOL if the project’s originators do not see <br>value in continuing to maintain them. This <br>has an adverse impact on downstream projects.<br>2.

As cited in Vasudeva (n 66). <br>IP and Licensing<br>Five types of IP are relevant in the context of <br>software in many jurisdictions: trade secret, <br>copyright, patent, designs, and trademark. 66 <br>However, not all these forms of IP protection are <br>utilised by individuals and organisations uniformly <br>across software, as their usage depends on the <br>developers’ preferences as well as on applicable <br>national laws.<br>The key critique of the traditional IP protection <br>system in the context of FOSS is that it inherently<br>conflicts with basic FOSS principles. For instance, <br>trade secrets protect confidential information,and <br>this is against the basic ethos of open source. In <br>fact, the FSF explicitly regards trade secrets as a <br>GPL (General Public License) violation.67<br>However, it needs to be noted that the open source <br>community has also tried to leverage some forms <br>of IP protection in a unique manner to protect <br>themselves at times. For instance, trademark is <br>a sign used for protecting source identification, <br>building consumer trust, and thereby also building <br>a brand, in the long term. So, while giving up <br>other forms of IP protection such as copyright, <br>patents and trade secrets, an organisation may rely <br>on their trademark-related rights to maintain the <br>competitive edge in the market. While the term <br>‘open source’ cannot be trademarked because of its <br>descriptive character,68 many members of the open <br>source community can be now seen leveraging <br>certification marks such as ‘OSI Certified’, 69 <br>administered by the OSI, to signal compliance <br>with open source principles.<br>The organisations surveyed for the study showed <br>an awareness of issues related to licensing and <br>patents but reported minimal direct challenges <br>with IP protection. This could be partly due to the<br>absence of any major litigations in India in the <br>area of FOSS. However, it also needs to be added <br>here that many respondents in our study noted <br>the need for careful consideration of licensing <br>terms and conditions, thereby indirectly indicating <br>consciousness about the underlying IP issues.<br>Challenges with regard to patent protection<br>Patents can grant exclusive control over inventions, <br>and their application in the realm of software has <br>always been a contentious issue, particularly in the <br>context of FOSS principles. 70 Richard Stallman <br>equates software patents to land mines, where <br>each design decision risks legal repercussions. 71 <br>Open source proponents seek to revisit patent <br>jurisprudence in the context of software programs <br>altogether, citing it as an ‘undeserved reward’. 72 <br>They point to issues such as the highly collaborative 60<br>and incremental character of innovations in the <br>area of software, the challenges associated with <br>prolonged patent terms, and the high potential for <br>abuse in the patent system.73<br>The open source community has developed some <br>strategies to mitigate some of these challenges. 74 <br>They include integrating patent clauses in licenses, <br>open patent movement, patent promises,75 creation <br>of patent pools, 76 creating prior art databases, 77 <br>promotion of rigorous prior art examination and <br>defensive publication strategies.78<br>However, patents still pose considerable challenges <br>for FOSS by virtue of factors such as the high cost of <br>patent litigation (making it difficult for most FOSS <br>projects to defend themselves against infringement <br>claims) and the existence of patent trolls who <br>seek patents merely for the purpose of extorting <br>money from others. The large number of patent <br>applications filed in many of the jurisdictions and <br>the manner in which patent applications are often <br>drafted (concealing the fact that the invention in <br>question is a software) poses additional challenges <br>for FOSS community.<br>As highlighted by Shuvam Misra of Remiges,    <br>patents remain a persistent concern for creators of <br>both open and closed-source software, necessitating <br>proactive risk mitigation strategies. The increasing <br>awareness of this threat within the FOSS <br>community has led organisations to offer protection <br>mechanisms. For instance, Red Hat assumes <br>liability for lawsuits related to their offerings, <br>shielding customers from legal consequences by <br>taking responsibility for contesting such cases in <br>court.<br>The open source community has also raised <br>concerns about the long-term impact on innovation, <br>particularly for smaller developers and companies.79 <br>In some instances, entire projects would have <br>to be halted due to a minor infringement claim <br>from the patent-holders of a proprietary program. <br>While cross-licensing (mutual exchange of patent <br>licenses rights between two or more parties) is a <br>mitigation tactic, it is understood to mostly benefit <br>large corporations as very few FOSS projects have <br>patents to trade.80<br>Moreover, empirical research suggests that IPR <br>enforcement actions can negatively impact FOSS <br>projects by decreasing user interest and developer <br>activity.81 For example, in the context of the SCO <br>v. IBM law suit, one study points out that the user <br>interest (measured by project downloads) showed <br>substantial decline following the initiation of the <br>suit. More specifically, after the lawsuit was filed, <br>FOSS projects having a high technology overlap <br>73.

Wen Wen, Chris Forman and Stuart JH Graham, ‘Research Note: The Impact of Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement on Open Source Software <br>Project Success’ (2013) 24 Information Systems Research 1131.61<br>with the concerned software witnessed around 15-<br>16% decline in monthly downloads, as compared <br>to a control group. Data also indicates a substantial <br>decline in developer activity and illustrates that in <br>FOSS projects with high technology overlap with <br>the concerned software, FOSS projects experienced <br>a 45% decrease in developer activity in comparison <br>to a control group.82<br>However, as indicated earlier, during our <br>interactions with different organisations as part of <br>this study, most organisations did not report facing <br>any direct software patent-related challenges. Only<br>one organisation reported a challenge they faced <br>relating to a cryptographic library patent. It needs <br>to be added that some organisations expressed <br>concerns about patents being a persistent issue, <br>emphasising the need for vigilance. In other words, <br>even if direct negative experiences in this area are <br>limited in the case of Indian organisations (probably <br>due to the restrictions on software patents under <br>the Patents Act, 1970 of India), they may still be <br>causing a chilling effect in the area.<br>Copyright Law<br>Copyright law plays the most important role <br>in the context of software. It treats software as a <br>‘literary work’, protected under Indian copyright <br>law. Some of the open movements like Creative <br>Commons have used the copyright framework <br>in creative ways to ensure wider dissemination of <br>software and other subject matters covered under <br>copyright law. As copyright protection is automatic <br>(no registration is required for getting protection) <br>in most jurisdictions, they achieve the objective of <br>broader dissemination of such works by providing <br>easy-to-use and easy-to-understand licenses that <br>allow a broad range of activities. In some instances, <br>this could mean relinquishing the entire copyright, <br>and in most instances, the developers would <br>only retain the specific right they wish to retain. <br>Attribution is one of such rights.<br>However, due to the fact that there are different <br>licensing options currently available, there is also <br>considerable divergence on licensing terms, despite <br>agreement on the OSS philosophy. To reduce <br>conflict and promote the growth of OSS, groups <br>like the OSI 83 and the FSF 84 have set definitional <br>standards for these licenses. The different licenses <br>can be classified in various ways, such as in terms of <br>control (academic vs permissive vs partially closable <br>vs reciprocal licenses) 85 and in terms of their <br>functional differences (permissive vs restrictive vs <br>highly restrictive licenses).86 <br>Among the different open source license options, it <br>is observed that the two licenses 87 most often used <br>by developers (based on the number of unique <br>pushes to GitHub) in India for 2024 (Q3) are <br>MIT88 and Apache-2.0.89 <br>82. ibid.<br>83. ‘Licenses’ (Open Source Initiative) <https://opensource.org/licenses> accessed 28 December 2024.<br>84. ‘FSF Licensing & Compliance Team’ (Free Software Foundation) <https://www.fsf.org/licensing/> accessed 26 January 2025.<br>85.

Robert Gomulkiewicz, ‘Open Source License Proliferation: Helpful Diversity or Hopeless Confusion?’ (2009) 30 Washington University Journal of Law & <br>Policy 261.64<br>Our case studies also show a strong preference <br>for permissive licenses like Apache and MIT. It <br>needs to be added that many of the organisations <br>explicitly expressed that they avoid GPL licenses, <br>citing concerns about its incompatibility with their <br>licenses and its restrictive licensing conditions. <br>One organisation clarified by adding that the <br>viral nature of licenses such as the GNU GPL is a <br>challenge for their FOSS adoption. <br>Additionally, out of the 12 organisations in our <br>sample who released the software they developed as <br>open source, we observe that there is roughly 50:50 <br>split between permissive and restrictive licensing.94  <br>‘Software should be open so that others  <br>can build on top of what I have done,  <br>and I can build on what others have done.’<br>Shuvam Misra, Founder-Chairman, Remiges<br>During our interactions, it was observed that <br>licensing conditions play a role in the decision-<br>making process and six organisations reported <br>instances wherein licensing conditions led them <br>to reject an FOSS component. While five of them <br>mentioned restrictive licensing conditions as the <br>reason, one organisation reported ambiguity in <br>license terms, which can lead to increased overhead, <br>as a legal team is required to provide clarity.<br>It may also be highlighted here that one healthcare <br>organisation emphasised prioritising quality and <br>suitability of the solution for patient care over a sub-<br>optimal solution to avoid licensing fees, indicating <br>an instance wherein operational priorities outweigh <br>licensing concerns.<br>94. While some of them mentioned the licenses used, for others, the same has been taken from their individual projects as released on GitHub.<br>95. John Walsh, ‘What’s Driving Changes in Open Source Licensing?’ (DevOps.com, 8 March 2024) <https://devops.com/whats-driving-changes-in-open-<br>source-licensing/> accessed 26 January 2025.<br>Shuvam Misra of Remiges mentioned a notable <br>example of the effect of viral license, MySQL’s <br>transition of its client libraries from LGPL to GPL <br>following its acquisition by Oracle. <br>With this change, Oracle database client libraries, <br>which are essential for connecting applications to <br>databases, became subject to GPL terms, requiring <br>developers to release their application as derivative <br>works under GPL. This shift created significant <br>challenges for enterprises relying on MySQL, as <br>it pressured them to purchase commercial support <br>agreements to avoid open sourcing their proprietary <br>software.<br>Distinction between GPL and LGPL: While <br>GPL applies its licensing requirements to all <br>derivative works, LGPL typically applies to shared <br>libraries without extending those requirements <br>to application code. This differentiation has <br>historically made LGPL the preferred licensing for <br>client libraries.<br>Vendor-driven FOSS projects are increasingly <br>facing competition from SaaS providers. It is <br>reported that these organisations engage in free <br>riding i.e., the use of OSS without contributing <br>anything in return. This has forced OSS vendors <br>such as MongoDB, Elastic, and Redis Labs to <br>modify their licenses in such a manner that restrict <br>the use of the software by third parties, or require <br>them to pay fees or share their modifications in <br>turn, thereby making the project less open.9565<br>Most organisations in our study are aware of <br>potential licensing risks that may arise in the <br>future due to changes in licensing of a software <br>project. Seven organisations outlined specific risk <br>mitigation strategies they have adopted, with some <br>employing more than one method. The outlined <br>strategies include issuing advisories and alternative <br>suggestions, adopting older versions, using the <br>latest and best fork of the project, implementing <br>modular architectures, and conducting regular <br>audits using SBOM.<br>In a nutshell, despite minimal direct conflicts <br>with IP and licensing, organisations studied as <br>part of this report exercise consistent caution and <br>adopt risk management practices. Some of them <br>also anticipate a rapid change in licensing-related <br>challenges due to AI-driven code development.<br>‘As the world moves to AI-driven  <br>software development, testing or code review  <br>and documentation, intellectual property  <br>[rights] for software [will] become obsolete  <br>in the next three to five years.’<br>Dilip Asbe, MD, CEO, NPCI<br>Software Stack<br>Eight of the organisations analysed in this report <br>have provided their software stack, stating the <br>extent to which different categories of software are <br>used in their organisation.
